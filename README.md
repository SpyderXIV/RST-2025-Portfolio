# RST-2025-Portfolio

Hello!

Welcome to Aidan Paz-Burke's 2025 ICS4U RST Portfolio!

Aidan's Portfolio is supposed to serve as a show of all the skills that he learned over the 2025 spring semester. To do this, Aidan's portfolio will include the following:

**Home page**

A landing page with a small description about the website, including Aidan's contact information for inquiries or bug reporting.

**About Me**

A page detailing who Aidan is and what he loves to do!

**Learning**

A page that details what we as a class learned over the semester.

**Projects**

A page that will show all of Aidan's previous projects that he worked on during the 2025 spring semester, including a short description of each.

**Something Phun**

A fun page (name is still a placeholder) that will probably be about something of Aidan's interest.

**Mr. J**

A page (totally not for extra credit) dedicated to why we love Mr. J!

Please note that as of now, this website is not finished, and bugs/errors are to be expected.

Thank you for visiting!
