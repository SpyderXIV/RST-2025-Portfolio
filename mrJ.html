  <h1>Mr. J</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the page dedicated to Mr. J</p>
  
  <p>As you may know by the title, this page is dedicated entirely to the man, the myth, the legend, Mr. J!</p>
  
  <p>Now you may ask yourself, "Why would this guy dedicate an entire page of his RST to his computer science teacher?" Well, fair enough, I don't think many people would've done this, but theres a pretty good readon as to why I dedicated this page to him. And thats because he is easily one of my favourite teachers, and probably one of the best teachers of all time. I've known Mr.J for I believe 3 years now, starting in grade 10, having him in grade 11, and finally having him in grade 12. Now I feel like I've had ample time to really reflect on this time that I've had with Mr. J as my teacher, and I can safely say, that I enjoyed my time with him as my teacher, and I could not have wished for any other computer science teacher.</p>

  <p>Thank you Mr. J, for everything you've done for me, and everything you've done to make my time in school, just a bit more enjoyable. :)</p>
