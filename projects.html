  <h1>My Semester Projects</h1>

  <div class="project">
    <h2>Project One - ASHStone</h2>
    <p>This project was the biggest project that we did over the semester. This project consisted of us getting into groups, in my case my group was Ben, Gabriel, and Loris, then coming up with a potential problem that needs fixing within our school community, and creating an application/website that could help out. So, my group decided on creating a "lost and found" website that allows kids to claim lost and found objects without having to go to the atrium, in an attempt to help clean up the rather unsightly pile of lost clothing and items. By the end of the semester, we completely finished our website, and it works perfectly, with no known errors after extensive testing (to our knowledge).</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h2>Project Two - ADT Presentation</h2>
    <p>This project was a little smaller, albeit still tough. This project consisted of us initially starting off solo, researching a number of ADTs (Abstract Data Types), which are used in Javascript to help streamline the interface for users, i.e hiding complex concepts with easy to understand interfaces. In this project, we had to create a lesson that would be presented to the class, which consisted of a lesson, quiz, and assignment. Once you created all of that, you were to get into groups of 3 or more (in my case, my group members were Loris and Haya), then combine the best aspects of eachother's presentations to create the best ADT presentation.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h2>Project Three - PyGamer</h2>
    <p>In this project, we were tasked with following a tutorial to create a "space invaders like" game on these little devices called "PyGamers". We had to completely do all the programing from scratch, and document any challenges we may have faced. For this project, much like the others, we had to do this in partners. In my case, my partner was Adrian. During this project, we did encouter a handful of hardships, but came out on top with very good results, and overall this project was really fun. </p>

  <div class="project">
    <h2>Project Four - CSE Robots</h2>
    <p>In this project, we were tasked with going through these lessons on programing these robots, to make sure that elemetary school children are able to follow along with little issues. Much like the PyGamer assignment, we did this in partners, where my partner was Adrian from the PyGamer assignment. During the project, we did not really encounter a large number of problems outside of potentially daunting code, just due to the sheer amount in some of the lessons. Overall, this was also a very fun assignment, Adrian and I even managed to make our robot traverse the entire second floor of the building!</p>
